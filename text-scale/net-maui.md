# Scale text - .NET MAUI

By default, .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps use the Open Sans font on each platform. However, this default can be changed, and additional fonts can be registered for use in an app.

All controls that display text automatically use font scaling, which means that an app's UI reflects text scaling preferences set in the operating system.

All you have to know about fonts and how to use them you can find this on ['.NET MAUI Fonts'](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/fonts?view=net-maui-8.0).
