# Frequent flashes - Android

On Android, flashing content often uses [`Executors`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/Executors), [`Handler`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler), or [`Timer`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Timer). Check if these objects are used to show more than three flashes per second.

If your app contains any videos, also check if these contain more than three flashes per second.
