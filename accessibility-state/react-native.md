# Accessibility state - React Native

In React Native you can use the [`accessibilityState`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilitystate) prop to set the accessibility state of an element. Available roles include `disabled`, `selected`, `checked`, `busy` and `expanded`, among others.

```jsx
<Pressable 
  accessibilityState="disabled|selected|checked|busy|expanded" />
```
