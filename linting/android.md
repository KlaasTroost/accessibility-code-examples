# Linting - Android

On Android you can use [`AndroidLint`](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/lint) to improve the quality of your code.

Check if you are using outdated code. In Android Studio you can check this by selecting the following menu options:

1. Kotlin
2. Migration
3. Usage of redundant or deprecated syntax or deprecated symbols

Avoid errors with automated testing. Follow the [UI-testing guide for Android](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing).

```kotlin
/AndroidSDK/tools/lint /project
```
